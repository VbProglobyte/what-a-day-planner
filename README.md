# credits 

I'd like to give credit to Stackoverflow & W3Schools!

I'd also like to credit Bootstrap & jQuery for helping developers make this "look" so easy (even though it is NOT)

And I'd like to give credit to Andrew T, who helped me troubleshoot local storage issues![screencapture-file-C-Users-Doug-Desktop-code-Homework-homework-SMU-day-planner-what-a-day-planner-index-html-2021-09-11-09_48_23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83515305/132951766-95694208-9f25-4232-9831-9fcdda59e73b.png)
