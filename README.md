Plan your day with this simple day planner!

# credits 

I'd like to give credit to Stackoverflow & W3Schools!

I'd also like to credit Bootstrap & jQuery for helping developers make this "look" so easy (even though it is NOT)

And I'd like to give credit to Andrew T, who helped me troubleshoot local storage issues!
